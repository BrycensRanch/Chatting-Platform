## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you spot any vulnerability, please notify mailto:brycengranville@outlook.com

As a student in HS and GitHub's Global Campus, it is my commitment to squash any vulnerabilities asap.

You can likely expect any vulnerability to be dealt with within a week or two, as I'm generally busy with my coursework.

If your vulnerability is accepted, I will push out a new version that fixes the reported vulnerability, regardless if it includes dropping dependencies or possibly refactoring the code. Whatever it takes. ðŸŒ‹

After that, it will be reported in the Security Advisories tab.

If your vulnerability is declined, no further action will be taken.
